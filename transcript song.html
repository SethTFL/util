<p> they cried to the Lord, but he did not answer them.</p>
<p>I beat them fine as the dust of the earth;</p>
<p> I crushed them and stamped them down like the mire of the streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You delivered me from strife with my people;</p>
<p> you kept me as the head of the nations;</p>
<p> people whom I had not known served me.</p>
<p>Foreigners came cringing to me;</p>
<p> as soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me.</p>
<p>Foreigners lost heart</p>
<p> and came trembling out of their fortresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Lord lives, and blessed be my rock,</p>
<p> and exalted be my God, the rock of my salvation,</p>
<p>the God who gave me vengeance</p>
<p> and brought down peoples under me,</p>
<p>who brought me out from my enemies;</p>
<p> you exalted me above those who rose against me;</p>
<p> you delivered me from men of violence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For this I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations,</p>
<p> and sing praises to your name.</p>
<p>Great salvation he brings to his king,</p>
<p> and shows steadfast love to his anointed,</p>
<p> to David and his offspring forever.”</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Father, we look from ourselves to you. Come by the Holy Spirit and quicken our minds. Guide my thoughts and my words, that we might hear from you in your Word, for Jesus’ sake. Amen.</p>
